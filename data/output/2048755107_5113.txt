on the amount of taxpayer f.:nds cl-:e Commonwealth has spent through
Medicaid and other -c-rograms to pay for smoking-related healt-z care_
costs.
It also seeks court crders requiring the defendants to
disclose their research on smoking, addiction and health; to fund
a remedial public education campaign on the health consequences of
smoking; and, to fund smokin; cessation programs for nicotine-
de_ne_r-dent smokers.

consoiracv_. It is time fcr :e _7dustry to be forced to tell the

they have done, " Harshbager sazd.
Inclucied among the ailega:icns in the complaint are references
to internal tobacco indust"a documents regarding the addictive
nature of nicotine tha`. contradict statements by the chief
executives of tobacco conpanies o-=fered as recently as last year in
congressional testimony. For examule, the general counsel of Browzl
&amp; Wi'-liamson wrote in 19E3 that: "Moreover, nicotine is addictive.
We are, then, in the ~zusiness of selling nicotine, an addictive
drug, effective in the release of stress mechanisms. "
The complaint further alleges that tobacco industry trade
associations are key instruments in carrying out the campaign to
mislead t`--le public and tha:i the campaign began as early as the

More chan 10,OC0 Massachuset=s citizens die each year from
smokinQ-related illnesses -- more than the combined annual deaths
caused by homicide, suicide, astomotive accidents, drugs and
alcchol abuse and AIDS. More than $200 million in taxpayer funds
are spen7:. every year in Massachusetts to provide health care for
those suffering from smoking-related illnesses. At the same time,
data shows that teen-age use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco
products is on the increase in Massachusetts and nationally.

prozection claims to the lawsuit at a later date.
In related action today, the Attorney General's Office filed
a mo~ion to dismiss the U.S. District Court lawsuit that the
cigarette companies f'_1ed late last month in an effort to prevent
:ars:r-barger from filing the Commonwealth's suit. The motion to -
dismiss argues that the industry's federal suit is merely a
nre-enptive action that raises issues that can be litigated and
decided in the state lawsuit.
