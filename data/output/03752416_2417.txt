MEMORANDUM
TO: Mr. Arthur J. Stevens
E`ROM: A. W. Spears

December 20,. 1973
SUBJECT: North Carolina.Sitate - Tobacco Breeding Program -
Lower "Tar" Content
][ have reviewed the above proposal by Doctor Keller at
North Carolina State. I am not particularly enthusiastic
about the proposal,, inithat.I don't think alsimple objective
of breeding tobacco with lower tar yield is going to have much
bearing on the tobacco and health question. However, if such
varieties can be devel'oped, they would represent samples for
bioassay to determine if the specific activity of the tar had
been modified. If this were the ca:se, (that is:, lower specific
activity) then the sample would be of further interest in
defining the chemical differences that.exist in the,condensate
composiition.
As you can see, there are a Ilot of ifs before one might.
obtain a.practical result. I would suggest that if' the other
companies are highly interested that we participate. Otherwise,
I would suggest not.
