The 3',5' Cyclic Monophosphate Syst-em in Carcinogenesis-
?he hynothesi.s of the Tronosed investigation suggests that cierical
carcinogens and tur^.or viruses alter the cel7l r:;mbrane. This alteration leads
to a loss of adenylata cyclase, the enzyre responsible for the synthesis of
adenosine cyclic 3',5' ir.onophosphate (cKta'). In previous orork, it :.as found
that cell generation time is directly relatc.d-to the cellular level of cav*?.
Further, t-unorigenic cell cultures have much less cP'IP and ademlate ^yclase
than normall dialoid cells. Indications are, therefore, that the loss of
adenylate cyclase may be an important eventt in carcinoc,er.esis.
It is proposed to measure the c':M , ste:cr during viral r....d
chemical carcinogenesis. In addition, ex,_eri:cents are p]am?ed to d_-terni:?
if exogenous c7.;? can alter the events of carcinogenssi, and prevent the
development of the malignant cell. Both _i_n_ vitro_ and in vivo syste::rs ..i11 __
